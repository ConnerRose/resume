\section{Projects}
\subheading{Historical Landmark Image Classifier}{}{October -- November 2023}
{Python, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Computer Vision}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and implemented \textbf{convolutional neural networks} for multiclass
          image classification of historical landmarks
    \item Researched \textbf{model architecture} and \textbf{data augmentation},
          employing subsampling and noise generation to improve accuracy and mitigate
          overfitting while training model with 5 convolutional layers and
          \textbf{+2,000,000} learnable parameters
    \item Utilized \textbf{transfer learning}, leveraging multiclass model to initialize
          weights for training on binary classification target problem, reducing training
          time, preventing overfitting, and fine-tuning fully-connected layers to improve
          performance

    \item Trained \textbf{support vector machines} capable of classifying positive and
          negative movie reviews achieving \textbf{92\%} accuracy through
          \textbf{sentiment analysis} techniques, including learned \textbf{word
              association} and \textbf{negation handling}
    \item Leveraged \textbf{word embedding association test} to determine association of
          gendered language with positive/negative adjectives in reviews, identifying
          gender bias within dataset and resulting learned support vector machines
\end{itemize}
\subheadingLine{MST/TSP Solution Generator}{C++}{April 2023}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed an implementation of \textbf{Prim's algorithm} to efficiently find
          \textbf{minimum spanning trees} for complete graphs
    \item Utilized \textbf{arbitrary insertion} heuristic approach to generate
          approximate solutions for the \textbf{traveling salesperson problem} with
          quadratic time complexity, allowing for computation for \textbf{+10,000-order}
          complete graphs in seconds
    \item Created a \textbf{branch and bound} algorithm to guarantee optimal solutions to
          the traveling salesperson problem and optimized via \textbf{solution tree
              pruning}, using MST-derived upper bound, reducing runtime by \textbf{90\%}
\end{itemize}
\subheadingLine{SQL Clone}{C++}{February 2023}
