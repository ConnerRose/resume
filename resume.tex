\section{Experience}
\subheading{IMC Trading}{Chicago, IL}{June -- August 2025}
{Software Engineer Intern - Equity Options Execution}{}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed component responsible for detecting and publishing \textbf{microstructural}
        signals to auto trading deployments
  \item Designed standalone C++ engine, achieving full feed handling on a single
        deployment via \textbf{multithreading}, replacing existing Java/C++ system, which
        previously required sharding traffic across several deployments per exchange
  \item Implemented backwards compatible test fixture to leverage existing component
        test suite for our new implementation
  \item Managed rollout to \textbf{live trading} on AMEX, working with traders to guarantee parity
        with existing component
\end{itemize}
\subheading{Bloomberg L.P.}{New York, NY}{June -- August 2024}
{Software Engineer Intern -- Enterprise Data, Index Core Data}{}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed and implemented dependency resolution and automated testing
        tool using \textbf{Python}, used by team of \textbf{80 engineers},
        reducing turnaround time when modifying bond formulas in distributed
        calculation engine by 80\%
  \item Expanded testing coverage from single-field to \textbf{end-to-end}, identifying
        existing bugs in calculation pipeline, and preventing bugs from being
        introduced that would not have been identified previously, resulting in
        more \textbf{robust system}
\end{itemize}
\subheading{Bloomberg L.P.}{New York, NY}{May -- August 2023}
{CTO Office Intern -- Compute Architecture and OSPO}{}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed automated access revocation system using \textbf{Python} and
        \textbf{LDAP}, deployed to \textbf{Docker}-containerized
        \textbf{Jenkins Pipeline}, ensuring appropriate removal of inactive
        accounts from Bloomberg's open-source GitHub repositories
  \item Developed GitHub crawler using \textbf{Python} to audit all projects
        contributed to by Bloomberg employees over 10 years, automating
        contribution cataloging and open-source license compliance
        verification, increasing audited projects by \textbf{3x}
\end{itemize}
